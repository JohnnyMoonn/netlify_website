      <h1>The Cyrodill City Guard</h1>
      <p>The guards are led by a captain, who reports to the local Count or Countess.</p>
      <p>Their duty is to uphold peace and order throughout the city and county, as well as ensuring justice is had in the event of a crime.</p> 
      <p>Additionally, they are the last line of defense of their city in the event of assault or invasion.</p>
      <p>Every County in Cyrodiil has its own Guard, these guards enforce the law and protect the capital cities of each County and the other villages or settlements</p>
      <p>All city guards wear very similar armor sets, differences are normally just the color of the sash and material of the undershirt used, either steel or chain mail.</p>
      <p>City guards also carry a shield which varies in color, and typically displays the insignia of the County across the front.</p>
